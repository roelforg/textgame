I see you're interested in developing for TEXTGAME.
It's build in C++.
Let's explain the dir. stucture.
repo_root
|\_doc Documentation for developers
|\_include Do i need to tell you what?
|\_lib Just the lib's (it also contains the levels unless you modify the makefiles and modify include/general.h)
|\_src The source dir
||\_levels This dir contains the levels
|||\_entry This is the dir from the entry level (you need to start somewhere right?)
|||\_exit This one will be called last (there is code in src/load.cpp to regulate that entry is run first and exit last)
|||\_skel This is an skeleton for one's level (the makefile in src/levels is set up to ignore this dir)

Let's start be making your own level (let's you get a feel for the stuff)!
Copy the skel dir e.g.
[code]
cp -R src/levels/skel src/levels/mylevel
[/code]
Modify src/levels/mylevel/Makefile and change
[code]
LEVEL=skeleton
[/code]
to
[code]
LEVEL=mylevel
[/code]
Open up src/level/main.cpp
Let's make a simple one, no challanges.
Uncomment the "NOEA" define
Put this after "#include <level_shared.h>":
[code]
vector<string> stuff;
[/code]
Put this in "init()":
[code]
	ADDV(stuff, "a door");
[/code]
And this in "handleCommand(string command)" after the "hC_begin" and before "hC_end" (yes, there shouldn't be a ";" after it):
[code]
	CMD("open") //define an command! (this is an macro from level_shared.h just like hC_*)
		if (args[1] == "door") //args is defined by hC_begin
		{
			cout << "The door opened!" << endl;
			goNextLevel(); //go to the next level
		}
		else
		{
			throw E_CMDNOTFOUND;	/*unless the "open door" sequence is given, this is an invalid command
						(there is a similar section in hC_end to throw this if you haven't spec'd a CMD that mached the command,
						but it doesn't get triggered if there is an non-matching arg instead of an non-matching command)*/
		}
	CMD("look")
		cout << "You see:" << endl;
		for (unsigned i = 0; i < stuff.size(); i++)
			cout << " * " << stuff[i] << endl;
[/code]
Note: You should add a help CMD that lists every CMD define you have included, in this case it should list "open" and "look".
Save, go to the top-dir of the tree, and run make (note: you *have* to run this from the repo-root as this passes a var around so there are some full paths, no DIR = stuff get's put in /lib and other dirs)
Now run ./bin/textgame
And play!
Hint:
The entry level (the first one) is simple!
(if you don't succeed, try to lift the flowerpot)
The first level shows the need for an "help" instruction defining all commands defined in the level (but not the order or the args needed ;P)

If you wan't to get a better look, try reading the TDWTFCOMMENTROOM level src.
